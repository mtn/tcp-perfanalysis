title: TCP Fairness
author: Michael Noronha
abstract: In response to shortcomings under various conditions, different versions of TCP have been developed. This analysis examines the relative fairness of these protocols with respect to base congestion in the network, simulated in NS-2 as a TCP streams passing through a single bottleneck link with varying congestion.
